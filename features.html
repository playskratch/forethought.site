<h1>Features</h1>
<p class="lede">
ForeThought is a macOS-native golf performance journal designed for retrospective logging.
It focuses on clarity, context, and long-term improvement — not live shot capture.
</p>

<hr/>

<section>
<h2>Dashboard & activity timeline</h2>
<p>
The Home view provides a chronological timeline of all logged activity — rounds,
practice sessions, lessons, and fitness.
</p>
<p>
Each entry is designed to be readable at a glance, while still linking to deeper
detail when required.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Round & competition logging</h2>
<p>
Log rounds after play with full context: course, ball, bag, notes, and scoring.
ForeThought prioritises reflective input rather than in-play interaction.
</p>
<p>
Rounds act as the foundation for long-term performance review and PDF reporting.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Practice session logging</h2>
<p>
Practice sessions are logged retrospectively and linked directly to the clubs used.
This allows meaningful review without disrupting time on the range.
</p>
<p>
Sessions support notes, focus areas, and session intent — encouraging deliberate practice
rather than raw volume.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Equipment management</h2>
<p>
ForeThought includes full equipment tracking, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple bags</li>
  <li>Club inventory</li>
  <li>Club ordering by number (not loft)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Equipment data feeds directly into practice analysis and reporting.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Wedge matrix & gapping tables</h2>
<p>
The wedge matrix and gapping tables provide a structured view of yardages across the bag.
These are designed to support real-world decision making rather than theoretical loft charts.
</p>
<p>
Gapping is displayed in a clean, readable format suitable for both self-review and export.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Ball & course management</h2>
<p>
Balls and courses are managed as first-class data objects.
</p>
<p>
This allows rounds and practice sessions to be viewed in context — accounting for
conditions, ball choice, and venue.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Fitness & non-golf activity tracking</h2>
<p>
ForeThought supports fitness and non-golf performance logging.
</p>
<p>
This allows physical preparation and conditioning to sit alongside golf activity,
recognising that performance is not built on practice alone.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Coach-ready PDF exports</h2>
<p>
ForeThought generates clean, monochrome PDF reports suitable for sharing with a coach.
</p>
<p>
Exports focus on clarity and structure rather than decoration, ensuring the data
remains the priority.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Lesson Logger Companion integration</h2>
<p>
Lessons can be logged via the Lesson Logger Companion app and imported into ForeThought
via JSON.
</p>
<p>
Lessons ultimately live inside ForeThought, where they can be reviewed alongside
practice, rounds, and reports.
</p>
</section>

<hr/>

<p class="muted">
ForeThought is actively developed and evolving. Feature scope reflects the current v1.9.x build.
