<h1>Everything you need to improve with intent</h1>

<p class="lede">
ForeThought is a structured golf performance hub designed for serious players.
Log with clarity. Review with context. Improve over time.
</p>

<hr/>

<!-- DASHBOARD -->
<section>
<h2>Dashboard & activity timeline</h2>
<p>
A clean chronological view of your entire golf journey — rounds, practice,
lessons, and fitness in one unified timeline.
</p>
<p>
Every entry is readable at a glance, with deeper drill-down available when needed.
No clutter. No noise.
</p>
</section>

<!-- ROUNDS -->
<section>
<h2>Round & competition logging</h2>
<p>
Log rounds retrospectively with full context: course, ball, bag, notes,
and scoring format.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stableford and medal support</li>
  <li>Hole-by-hole structure</li>
  <li>Equipment and condition context</li>
  <li>Competition-ready tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rounds form the foundation of long-term performance analysis and reporting.
</p>
</section>

<!-- PRACTICE -->
<section>
<h2>Structured practice tracking</h2>
<p>
Practice is logged after completion, encouraging deliberate reflection
rather than distraction.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Session focus areas</li>
  <li>Clubs used</li>
  <li>Intent and outcomes</li>
  <li>Linked equipment context</li>
</ul>
<p>
Designed to support meaningful improvement — not just volume.
</p>
</section>

<!-- EQUIPMENT -->
<section>
<h2>Equipment management</h2>
<p>
Track your setup with clarity and precision.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple bags</li>
  <li>Full club inventory</li>
  <li>Explicit club numbering (2–PW)</li>
  <li>Ball tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>
Equipment data connects directly to sessions and performance trends.
</p>
</section>

<!-- GAPPING -->
<section>
<h2>Wedge matrix & gapping tables</h2>
<p>
Understand your yardages with structure.
</p>
<p>
ForeThought provides clean, readable gapping tables and wedge matrices
designed for real-world decision making — not theoretical loft charts.
</p>
<p>
Perfect for both personal review and coach discussions.
</p>
</section>

<!-- COURSE -->
<section>
<h2>Course management</h2>
<p>
Courses are treated as structured data, not just names.
</p>
<p>
This allows rounds to be analysed with full venue context —
supporting deeper insight into scoring patterns and conditions.
</p>
</section>

<!-- FITNESS -->
<section>
<h2>Fitness & physical preparation</h2>
<p>
Performance is not built on golf alone.
</p>
<p>
ForeThought supports fitness and conditioning logs so that physical preparation
sits alongside rounds and practice — giving a complete development record.
</p>
</section>

<!-- REPORTS -->
<section>
<h2>Coach-ready PDF exports</h2>
<p>
Turn data into conversation.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Season summaries</li>
  <li>Scoring breakdowns</li>
  <li>Equipment insights</li>
  <li>Performance trends</li>
</ul>
<p>
Exports are clean, structured, and monochrome — designed for clarity,
not decoration.
</p>
</section>

<!-- LESSON LOGGER -->
<section>
<h2>Lesson Logger Companion integration</h2>
<p>
Lessons captured in the iOS Lesson Logger Companion app
are imported directly into ForeThought via structured JSON.
</p>
<p>
Once imported, lessons live alongside practice sessions,
rounds, and performance data — completing the workflow.
</p>
</section>

<hr/>

<p class="muted">
ForeThought is macOS-only and built for retrospective logging.
There is no live shot capture during play.
Designed and developed with a focus on clarity, structure,
and long-term improvement.
