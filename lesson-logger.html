    <h1>Lesson Logger Companion</h1>

    <p class="lede">
      Lesson Logger Companion is a lightweight capture app designed specifically
      for logging lessons and coaching sessions in the moment.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why a companion app exists</h2>
      <p>
        ForeThought is intentionally designed for retrospective logging on macOS.
        Lessons, however, often require quick capture during a coaching session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lesson Logger Companion exists to bridge that gap without compromising
        ForeThought’s core philosophy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Focused, in-the-moment capture</h2>
      <p>
        The Companion app is designed to be used during a lesson — capturing
        thoughts, drills, changes, and coaching notes as they happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        It avoids analysis, dashboards, and exports, keeping the experience fast
        and unobtrusive.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Lessons live in ForeThought</h2>
      <p>
        Lesson Logger Companion is not a standalone analysis tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lessons are exported as structured JSON files and imported into ForeThought,
        where they live alongside practice sessions, rounds, and reports.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Clear separation of responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        This separation allows each application to do one job well:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lesson Logger Companion focuses on capture</li>
        <li>ForeThought focuses on reflection and analysis</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, they form a complete workflow without overloading either side.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data ownership</h2>
      <p>
        Lessons are stored as plain data and transferred manually via JSON.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no account system, background sync, or hosted service involved.
        You remain in control of where your data lives.
      </p>
    </section>

    <hr/>

    <p class="muted">
      Lesson Logger Companion exists to support ForeThought — not to replace it.
