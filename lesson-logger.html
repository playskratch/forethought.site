  <!-- PURPOSE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Built for the lesson environment</h2>
    <p>
      Coaching sessions move quickly. Swing thoughts evolve.
      Drills change. Feels adjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lesson Logger Companion is designed specifically for in-the-moment capture —
      without dashboards, analytics, or visual noise.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FEATURES -->
  <section>
    <h2>What you can capture</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Coach and lesson date tracking</li>
      <li>Session focus areas (driver, irons, wedges, putting)</li>
      <li>Swing changes and key feels</li>
      <li>Ball flight patterns and miss tendencies</li>
      <li>Assigned drills and practice priorities</li>
      <li>Structured notes with fast editing</li>
      <li>Clear lesson summaries</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- DESIGN PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section>
    <h2>Focused by design</h2>
    <p>
      Lesson Logger Companion avoids analysis during capture.
      There are no performance charts or statistical overlays.
    </p>
    <p>
      It keeps the interface clean so your attention stays on the lesson —
      not on the app.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WORKFLOW -->
  <section>
    <h2>Designed to work with ForeThought</h2>
    <p>
      Lessons are exported as structured JSON files and imported directly into
      ForeThought on macOS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once imported, lessons integrate with your practice sessions, rounds,
      equipment data, and long-term performance analysis.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- DATA OWNERSHIP -->
  <section>
    <h2>Your data stays yours</h2>
    <p>
      There are no accounts, subscriptions, or background sync services.
      Lesson data is stored locally and transferred manually.
    </p>
    <p>
      You remain in full control of your performance history.
    </p>
  </section>
