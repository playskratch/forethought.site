  <p class="lede">
    Fast. Focused. In-the-moment lesson capture.
    Built to work seamlessly with ForeThought.

  <!-- WHY IT EXISTS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why a companion app exists</h2>
    <p>
      ForeThought is intentionally designed for structured reflection on macOS.
      It is not built for live input during a coaching session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lessons move quickly. Thoughts change. Drills evolve.
      Lesson Logger Companion exists to capture everything as it happens —
      without compromising ForeThought’s philosophy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FEATURES -->
  <section>
    <h2>Structured lesson capture</h2>
    <p>
      Lesson Logger Companion is designed specifically for coaching sessions.
      It keeps the interface minimal and responsive while capturing meaningful data.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lesson date and coach tracking</li>
      <li>Session focus (e.g. driver, wedges, putting)</li>
      <li>Key swing changes and feels</li>
      <li>Drills assigned</li>
      <li>Practice priorities</li>
      <li>Ball flight notes and tendencies</li>
      <li>Structured session notes</li>
      <li>Quick-edit workflow during live sessions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- DESIGN PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section>
    <h2>Focused by design</h2>
    <p>
      There are no dashboards. No analytics. No exports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lesson Logger Companion does one job well:
      capture information clearly and efficiently while you are on the range.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WORKFLOW -->
  <section>
    <h2>Integrated workflow</h2>
    <p>
      Lessons are exported as structured JSON files and imported directly into
      ForeThought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once imported, lessons live alongside rounds, practice sessions,
      equipment data, and performance trends — creating a complete,
      long-term development record.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- DATA OWNERSHIP -->
  <section>
    <h2>Your data. Your control.</h2>
    <p>
      There is no account system, no cloud sync, and no hosted service.
      Lessons are stored as plain structured data and transferred manually.
    </p>
    <p>
      You decide where your data lives.
    </p>
  </section>

  <hr/>

  <p class="muted">
    Lesson Logger Companion and ForeThought form a two-part system:
    capture in the moment, reflect with clarity.
