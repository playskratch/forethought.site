  <!-- PRACTICE -->

    <h2>Structured practice logging</h2>
    <p>
      Practice is where improvement happens. ForeThought captures it properly.
      Log sessions after you finish. Track focus areas, clubs used, outcomes,
      and patterns over time without touching your phone on the range.
    </p>

    <h2>Equipment clarity</h2>
    <p>
      Your bag tells a story. ForeThought connects it to performance.
      Manage clubs, gapping tables, and wedge matrices in one clean view.
      Tie yardages directly to real sessions and real outcomes.
