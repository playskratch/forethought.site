<h1>How ForeThought works</h1>

<p class="lede">
ForeThought is intentionally different from live-shot tracking apps.
It is designed for reflection, not distraction.
</p>

<hr/>

<section>
<h2>macOS-native by design</h2>
<p>
ForeThought is a macOS application built for post-round and post-session analysis.
It is not intended to be used during play or practice.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Retrospective logging</h2>
<p>
All rounds, practice sessions, and fitness activities are logged after completion.
</p>
<p>
This approach encourages honest reflection without interrupting play,
practice flow, or coaching sessions.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>No live capture</h2>
<p>
ForeThought does not perform live shot capture, GPS tracking, or in-play interaction.
</p>
<p>
This is a deliberate design decision to keep focus on learning and review rather than
real-time data collection.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Lessons handled separately</h2>
<p>
In-the-moment lesson logging is handled by the Lesson Logger Companion app.
</p>
<p>
Lessons are later imported into ForeThought, where they are reviewed and analysed
alongside all other activity.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Local-first data</h2>
<p>
Data is stored locally and can be synced via iCloud Drive.
</p>
<p>
There is no mandatory account system, cloud service, or subscription.
</p>
</section>

ForeThought is designed for golfers who value clarity, context, and long-term improvement.

        Log practice sessions after you finish. Track clubs used, session focus,
