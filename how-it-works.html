<h1>Designed for reflection</h1>

<p class="lede">
ForeThought is intentionally different from live-shot tracking apps.
It prioritises clarity, structure, and long-term development over real-time data capture.
</p>

<hr/>

<!-- MACOS -->
<section>
<h2>Built for macOS</h2>
<p>
ForeThought is a native macOS application designed for post-round
and post-session review.
</p>
<p>
It lives where analysis belongs — on a larger screen,
with space to think clearly and review properly.
</p>
</section>

<!-- RETROSPECTIVE -->
<section>
<h2>Log after you play</h2>
<p>
All rounds, practice sessions, lessons, and fitness activity
are recorded retrospectively.
</p>
<p>
This encourages honest reflection without interrupting
play, practice flow, or coaching sessions.
</p>
</section>

<!-- NO LIVE CAPTURE -->
<section>
<h2>No live shot tracking</h2>
<p>
ForeThought does not perform GPS tracking,
live shot capture, or in-play interaction.
</p>
<p>
This is a deliberate design choice.
The goal is understanding patterns over time —
not reacting to data mid-round.
</p>
</section>

<!-- LESSON WORKFLOW -->
<section>
<h2>Capture in the moment. Reflect later.</h2>
<p>
In-the-moment lesson capture is handled by
the Lesson Logger Companion iOS app.
</p>
<p>
Lessons are exported as structured data and imported
into ForeThought, where they integrate with practice,
rounds, and performance trends.
</p>
</section>

<!-- LOCAL FIRST -->
<section>
<h2>Local-first by design</h2>
<p>
All data is stored locally, with optional syncing
via iCloud Drive.
</p>
<p>
There are no mandatory accounts, no subscriptions,
and no hosted service requirements.
</p>
<p>
Your performance history remains under your control.
</p>
</section>

<hr/>

<p class="muted">
ForeThought is macOS-only and focused on structured,
retrospective logging.  
Built with clarity, discipline, and long-term improvement in mind.
