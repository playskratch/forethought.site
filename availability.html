    <h1>Availability</h1>

    <p class="lede">
      ForeThought is currently a private macOS application under active development.
    </p>

      <h2>Current status</h2>
      <p>
        ForeThought is in regular personal use and is actively evolving.
        Features, workflows, and exports are refined through real-world logging
        rather than public release cycles.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Platform</h2>
      <p>
        ForeThought is built exclusively for macOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is designed as a desktop application for reflective logging and analysis,
        not as a mobile or web-based service.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Distribution</h2>
      <p>
        ForeThought is not currently available for public download and is not listed
        on the Mac App Store.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no subscription, account system, or hosted service associated with
        the application.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Future availability</h2>
      <p>
        Decisions around wider distribution will be made once the feature set,
        workflows, and long-term direction have fully settled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any future availability will prioritise the same principles that guide
        the current build: clarity, simplicity, and control over data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <hr/>

    <p class="muted">
      ForeThought is built as a long-term personal performance journal, not a
      short-term product launch.
